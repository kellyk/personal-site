# Debounce vs Throttle

I have Googled this so many times! It's time to write it down! But first, a visual demo:



## What is Debounce?

Debounce will delay calling a function until some interval has passed _since it was last called_. Unlike throttle, the function will not be invoked when a user first takes an action!

Use cases:
- Typeahead

```
function debounce(cb, delay = 1000) {
    let timeout;
    return (...args) => {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(() => {
            cb(...args)
        }, delay);
    }
}
```

## What is Throttle?

Throttle will ensure a function is only called once per interval. The initial call is run right away, unlike with debounce.

Use cases:
- Responding to mouse movements
- Responding to scroll events

```
function throttle(cb, delay = 1000) {
  let shouldWait = false;

  return (...args) => {
    if (shouldWait) return;

    cb(...args);
    shouldWait = true;

    setTimeout(() => {
      shouldWait = false;
    }, delay);
  }
}
```

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:

- Node.js installed (version 14.6.0 or newer)
- A code editor (I recommend VS Code)
- Basic knowledge of React

## Creating Your First Next.js Project

Let's create a new Next.js project using the official starter:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
```

The CLI will ask you a few questions about your project setup. For this tutorial, I recommend selecting:

- TypeScript: Yes
- ESLint: Yes
- Tailwind CSS: Yes
- App Router: Yes

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should see the Next.js welcome page.

## Understanding the File Structure

Let's take a look at the key files and directories in a Next.js project:

- `app/`: Contains your application pages and routes (with App Router)
- `public/`: Stores static assets like images and fonts
- `next.config.js`: Next.js configuration file
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts

## Creating Your First Page

In Next.js with the App Router, each folder represents a route segment, and the `page.tsx` file within it represents the UI for that route.

Let's create a simple about page. Create a new folder `app/about` and add a `page.tsx` file:

```tsx
export default function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h1>
      <p>
        This is the about page of my Next.js application. I'm learning how to
        build modern web applications with React and Next.js.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now visit `http://localhost:3000/about` to see your new page.

## Conclusion

This is just the beginning of your journey with Next.js. In future posts, I'll cover more advanced topics such as:

- Data fetching strategies
- Creating dynamic routes
- Optimizing images and performance
- Deployment options

Happy coding!
