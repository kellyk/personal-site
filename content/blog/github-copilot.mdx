## Autocomplete tips

### Multiple suggestions
When you are offered ghost text for a suggestion, there are sometimes multiple options you can choose from!

You can cycle through prev and next suggestions via:

- `Option` + `]`
- `Option` + `[`

This seemed to work better / more consistently for me after I hovered over the "ghost text" suggestion to get the context menu, and then selected "Always Show Toolbar."

### Accepting a partial suggestion
I typically click `tab` to accept an entire suggestion, but also learned that you can accept one word at a time via:
- `Command` + `â†’`

This is the default keyboard shortcut, but to get this one working, I had to open Keyboard Settings (via Command Palette) and clear and then retype the keys.*

## Improving suggestions

There are a few tricks you can use to help Copilot give you better suggestions:

- **Descriptive function names**: to help Copilot understand what you want!
- **Psuedocode comments**: Add a comment with instructions for Copilot, eg. <br /> `// Create tr with tds for name and age. Use template strings.`
- **Paste reference code**: In your comment, you can paste (and then later delete) relevant variables/fields to hint to Copilot
<br />`// These are model fields: name=models.Char, amount=models.decimal`,
- **Extract a variable**: Pulling values into a well-named array or enum can improve places those values are referenced later

## Context

By default, Copilot only uses open files for context.

- **Specific file**: You can reference a particular file by typing `#` and the filename. Once you type `#`, Copilot should suggest existing files in a typeahead menu!
- **All open files**: You can make Copilot consider the entire codebase by prefacing your message with `@workspace`.


## Chat and Agent Modes

### Chat mode
- Type a `/` for available commands
- Good questions to ask:
  - How can I refactor this?
  - How can I improve readability?
  - Create unit testing headers for this file
  - Ask for executable code like "How do I start a python server in my terminal", etc


### Agent mode

With Agent mode, it will make changes and create files for you rather than responding as a chat conversation. It will still offer the diff for you to accept or modify or reject.
<br />
To switch to Agent mode:
- Use the command palette: `>Chat: Open Chat (Agent)`
- `Commad` + `Shift` + `i` also seems to work!
