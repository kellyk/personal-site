## Shortcuts

Cycle through suggestions

- Next: `Option` + `]`
- Previous: `Option` + `[`

*Note that this seemed to work better / more consistently for me after I hovered over the "ghost text" suggestion to get the context menu, and then selected "Always Show Toolbar."*

Accept next word from suggestion
- `Command` + `â†’`

*For this one to work, I had to open Keyboard Settings (via Command Palette) and clear and then retype the keys.*

## Improving suggestions

- Pull list/enum into a variable or enumerate the options in a comment to improve places those vals are referenced later
- Create a comment block and add a note for Copilot, eg `Create tr with tds for name and age. Use template strings.`
- Comments could include pasting relevant variables/fields to hint to Copilot, eg `\\ These are model fields: name=models.Char, amount=models.decimal...`, then continue your code.

## Context

By default, Copilot only uses open files for context. You can make it use the entire codebase by prefacing your question with `@workspace`.

## Chat and Agent Modes

### Chat
- Type a `/` for available commands
- Reference particular files with `#file:filename`
- Good questions to ask:
  - How can I refactor this?
  - How can I improve readability?
  - Create unit testing headers for this file
  - Ask for executable code like "How do I start a python server in my terminal", etc


### Agent Mode

With Agent mode, it will make changes and create files for you rather than responding as a chat conversation. It will still offer the diff for you to accept or modify or reject.

Opening
- Open agent mode using the command palette: `>Chat: Open Chat (Agent)`
- `Commad` + `Shift` + `i` also seems to open agent mode.
