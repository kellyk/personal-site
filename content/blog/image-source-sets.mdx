# Using Image Source Sets for Responsive Images

When building websites, one of the key challenges is serving images that look great on all devices — from tiny smartphones to large desktop screens — without slowing down your site. This is where **`srcset`** and **`sizes`** attributes come into play, letting browsers choose the best image for the user's device and connection.

#### What is `srcset`?

`srcset` is an attribute on the `<img>` tag that provides multiple image sources along with their sizes. The browser then picks the most appropriate image based on the device's viewport and resolution.

Here's a simple example:

```html
<img
  src="images/photo-800.jpg"
  srcset="
    images/photo-400.jpg 400w,
    images/photo-800.jpg 800w,
    images/photo-1200.jpg 1200w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw"
  alt="Beautiful scenery">
```

- The `srcset` lists three images with their widths (`400w`, `800w`, `1200w`).
- The `sizes` attribute tells the browser how much space the image will take up at different viewport widths.

#### How does it work?

The browser evaluates the `sizes` and `srcset` to determine which image to download. For example:

- On a small screen (max-width 600px), the image will likely be small, so the browser picks the `400w` image.
- On larger screens, it might choose the `1200w` image for better quality.

This dynamic selection saves bandwidth and improves load times, especially on mobile.

#### Why use `srcset`?

- **Responsive Design:** Serve appropriately scaled images.
- **Performance:** Reduce unnecessary data transfer.
- **Better User Experience:** Faster load times and crisp images on high-res screens.

### Wrapping Up

`srcset` is a powerful tool for modern web development. It helps your site be smarter about images, making it faster and look better everywhere. Combine it with `sizes` for even more control, and you'll have a responsive image strategy that keeps users happy and your site lean.
