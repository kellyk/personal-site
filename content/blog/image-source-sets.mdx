# Image Source Sets for Responsive Images

We want to serve images that look great on all devices — from tiny smartphones to large desktop screens — without slowing down your site. This is where **srcset** and **sizes** attributes come into play, letting browsers choose the best image for the user's device and connection.

## What is srcset?

**srcset** is an attribute on the \<img> tag that provides multiple image sources along with their sizes. The browser then picks the most appropriate image based on the device's viewport and resolution.

Here's a simple example:

```html
<img
  src="images/photo-800.jpg"
  srcset="
    images/photo-400.jpg 400w,
    images/photo-800.jpg 800w,
    images/photo-1200.jpg 1200w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw"
  alt="Beautiful scenery">
```

- The **srcset** lists three images with their widths (400w, 800w, 1200w).
- The **sizes** attribute tells the browser how much space the image will take up at different viewport widths.

## How does it work?

The browser evaluates the **sizes** and **srcset** to determine which image to download. For example:

- On a small screen (max-width 600px), the image will likely be small, so the browser picks the 400w image.
- On larger screens, it might choose the 1200w image for better quality.

This dynamic selection saves bandwidth and improves load times, especially on mobile.

## What happens if you don't provide a sizes attribute?

If you don't provide a sizes attribute in your \<img> tag with **srcset**, the browser will usually assume the image will be displayed at its actual rendered size (or the intrinsic size of the \<img>). It then selects the best image from **srcset** based solely on the pixel density and viewport width, without considering your layout or CSS styling.


## Why use srcset?

- **Responsive Design:** Serve appropriately scaled images.
- **Performance:** Reduce unnecessary data transfer.
- **Better User Experience:** Faster load times and crisp images on high-res screens.

## Wrapping Up

**srcset** is a powerful tool for modern web development. It helps your site be smarter about images, making it faster and look better everywhere. Combine it with **sizes** for even more control, and you'll have a responsive image strategy that keeps users happy and your site lean.
